It is important to understand that free response questions are designed to elicit one of five cognitive processes from readers: Paraphrasing, Elaboration, Logic, Prediction, and Bridging.\\n[START HIGHLIGHTED CHUNK]\\nIn a nation, the law can serve to (1) keep the peace, (2) maintain the status quo, (3) preserve individual rights, (4) protect minorities against majorities, (5) promote social justice, and (6) provide for orderly social change. Some legal systems serve these purposes better than others. Although a nation ruled by an authoritarian government may keep the peace and maintain the status quo, it may also oppress minorities or political opponents (e.g., Burma, Zimbabwe, or Iraq under Saddam Hussein). Under colonialism, European nations often imposed peace in countries whose borders were somewhat arbitrarily created by those same European nations. Over several centuries prior to the twentieth century, empires were built by Spain, Portugal, Britain, Holland, France, Germany, Belgium, and Italy. With regard to the functions of the law, the empire may have kept the peace—largely with force—but it changed the status quo and seldom promoted the native peoples’ rights or social justice within the colonized nation.\\n\\nIn nations that were former colonies of European nations, various ethnic and tribal factions have frequently made it difficult for a single, united government to rule effectively. In Rwanda, for example, power struggles between Hutus and Tutsis resulted in genocide of the Tutsi minority. (Genocide is the deliberate and systematic killing or displacement of one group of people by another group. In 1948, the international community formally condemned the crime of genocide.) In nations of the former Soviet Union, the withdrawal of a central power created power vacuums that were exploited by ethnic leaders. When Yugoslavia broke up, the different ethnic groups—Croats, Bosnians, and Serbians—fought bitterly for home turf rather than share power. In Iraq and Afghanistan, the effective blending of different groups of families, tribes, sects, and ethnic groups into a national governing body that shares power remains to be seen.\\n[END HIGHLIGHTED CHUNK]\\nNow, you will need to generate a elaboration question based on the highlighted chunk. In this context, elaboration means the process of making inferences that link what is in the text or sentence to related to a reader’s background knowledge. Readers use specific prior knowledge or learned experiences to understand a text by developing inferences based on specific background knowledge. Write only one question and do not provide any opening, closing, or explanations.<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant', prompt_token_ids=[1, 32001, 5205, 13, 6113, 263, 3889, 2933, 1139, 2729, 373, 278, 1494, 12141, 287, 19875, 515, 385, 15278, 284, 1426, 25278, 376, 16890, 3335, 7927, 322, 278, 5682, 284, 16738, 1642, 739, 338, 4100, 304, 2274, 393, 3889, 2933, 5155, 526, 8688, 304, 560, 293, 277, 697, 310, 5320, 25323, 3321, 10174, 515, 22176, 29901, 1459, 481, 1092, 5832, 29892, 1260, 3717, 362, 29892, 4522, 293, 29892, 21099, 2463, 29892, 322, 1771, 333, 3460, 29889, 13, 29961, 25826, 379, 6259, 29950, 5265, 29954, 3912, 3352, 5868, 3904, 29968, 29962, 13, 797, 263, 5233, 29892, 278, 4307, 508, 9080, 304, 313, 29896, 29897, 3013, 278, 10776, 29892, 313, 29906, 29897, 7344, 278, 4660, 439, 29877, 29892, 313, 29941, 29897, 19905, 5375, 10462, 29892, 313, 29946, 29897, 12566, 9461, 1907, 2750, 4655, 1907, 29892, 313, 29945, 29897, 27391, 5264, 15426, 29892, 322, 313, 29953, 29897, 3867, 363, 1797, 368, 5264, 1735, 29889, 3834, 11706, 6757, 9080, 1438, 11976, 2253, 1135, 4045, 29889, 8512, 263, 5233, 29490, 491, 385, 4148, 3673, 713, 5874, 1122, 3013, 278, 10776, 322, 7344, 278, 4660, 439, 29877, 29892, 372, 1122, 884, 4575, 1253, 9461, 1907, 470, 8604, 23995, 1237, 313, 29872, 29889, 29887, 1696, 6640, 655, 29892, 796, 19977, 370, 705, 29892, 470, 21375, 29939, 1090, 317, 1202, 314, 24287, 24195, 467, 7634, 25539, 1608, 29892, 7824, 19079, 4049, 527, 4752, 10776, 297, 10916, 5069, 28199, 892, 10579, 9727, 6275, 2825, 491, 1906, 1021, 7824, 19079, 29889, 6811, 3196, 21726, 7536, 304, 278, 3252, 7268, 621, 6462, 29892, 3710, 2658, 892, 4240, 491, 13616, 29892, 12077, 29892, 14933, 29892, 20262, 29892, 3444, 29892, 9556, 29892, 9923, 1974, 29892, 322, 12730, 29889, 2973, 4880, 304, 278, 3168, 310, 278, 4307, 29892, 278, 3710, 533, 1122, 505, 8126, 278, 10776, 30003, 27489, 873, 411, 4889, 30003, 4187, 372, 3939, 278, 4660, 439, 29877, 322, 269, 2495, 290, 21201, 278, 7531, 1236, 459, 793, 30010, 10462, 470, 5264, 15426, 2629, 278, 8104, 1891, 5233, 29889, 13, 13, 797, 19079, 393, 892, 4642, 8104, 583, 310, 7824, 19079, 29892, 5164, 11314, 7823, 322, 9434, 284, 2258, 1953, 505, 13672, 1754, 372, 5189, 363, 263, 2323, 29892, 443, 1573, 5874, 304, 5751, 17583, 29889, 512, 390, 29893, 5863, 29892, 363, 1342, 29892, 3081, 10205, 793, 1546, 379, 329, 375, 322, 323, 8842, 275, 20601, 297, 2531, 29877, 8204, 310, 278, 323, 329, 1039, 9461, 537, 29889, 313, 29954, 8154, 8204, 338, 278, 23663, 403, 322, 1788, 2454, 23393, 470, 12272, 9552, 310, 697, 2318, 310, 2305, 491, 1790, 2318, 29889, 512, 29871, 29896, 29929, 29946, 29947, 29892, 278, 6121, 7881, 28269, 24905, 9571, 278, 17268, 310, 2531, 29877, 8204, 1846, 512, 19079, 310, 278, 4642, 15308, 7761, 29892, 278, 28679, 284, 310, 263, 6555, 3081, 2825, 3081, 11757, 29884, 6762, 393, 892, 16035, 1573, 491, 11314, 7823, 20251, 29889, 1932, 612, 688, 17464, 423, 14455, 701, 29892, 278, 1422, 11314, 7823, 6471, 30003, 29907, 307, 1446, 29892, 10211, 1240, 550, 29892, 322, 1816, 5365, 550, 30003, 29888, 1774, 22773, 368, 363, 3271, 7013, 29888, 3265, 1135, 6232, 3081, 29889, 512, 21375, 29939, 322, 27135, 9777, 29892, 278, 11828, 1999, 2548, 310, 1422, 6471, 310, 13175, 29892, 29201, 29892, 21149, 29879, 29892, 322, 11314, 7823, 6471, 964, 263, 4797, 14765, 1076, 3573, 393, 29358, 3081, 9242, 304, 367, 3595, 29889, 13, 29961, 11794, 379, 6259, 29950, 5265, 29954, 3912, 3352, 5868, 3904, 29968, 29962, 13, 10454, 29892, 366, 674, 817, 304, 5706, 263, 13771, 362, 1139, 2729, 373, 278, 12141, 287, 19875, 29889, 512, 445, 3030, 29892, 13771, 362, 2794, 278, 1889, 310, 3907, 10115, 2063, 393, 1544, 825, 338, 297, 278, 1426, 470, 10541, 304, 4475, 304, 263, 9591, 30010, 29879, 3239, 7134, 29889, 7523, 414, 671, 2702, 7536, 7134, 470, 10972, 27482, 304, 2274, 263, 1426, 491, 14338, 10115, 2063, 2729, 373, 2702, 3239, 7134, 29889, 14350, 871, 697, 1139, 322, 437, 451, 3867, 738, 8718, 29892, 14382, 29892, 470, 7309, 800, 19423, 29989, 326, 29918, 355, 29989, 29958, 13, 29966, 29989, 326, 29918, 2962, 29989, 29958, 465, 22137], prompt_logprobs=None, outputs=[CompletionOutput(index=0, text='\\nWhat challenges have former colonies of European nations faced in establishing a single, united government, and how have these challenges manifested in contemporary conflicts and power struggles?', token_ids=[13, 5618, 18066, 267, 505, 4642, 8104, 583, 310, 7824, 19079, 20050, 297, 10127, 292, 263, 2323, 29892, 443, 1573, 5874, 29892, 322, 920, 505, 1438, 18066, 267, 14682, 2868, 297, 24952, 28792, 322, 3081, 10205, 793, 29973, 2], cumulative_logprob=-18.702448813033556, logprobs=None, finish_reason=stop)], finished=True, metrics=RequestMetrics(arrival_time=346691.318144302, last_token_time=346691.318144302, first_scheduled_time=1708808765.7598057, first_token_time=1708808765.943147, time_in_queue=1708462074.4416614, finished_time=1708808767.4788978), lora_request=None)]"
